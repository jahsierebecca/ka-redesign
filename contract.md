# Karnes Allen Group Website Redesign Contract

Between Jahsie Ault and Karnes Allen Group 

## Summary: 

I'll do my very best to fulfil your needs and meet your expectations, but it’s important to have things written down so that we both know what’s what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong. In this contract you won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. I have no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. What we do want is what’s best for both parties, now and in the future.

So in short;

You Karnes Allen Group, located at P.O. Box 44194, Boise, ID 83711 are hiring Jahsie Ault to design and develop a web site free of charge. Of course it’s a little more complicated, but we’ll get to that.

## What do both parties agree to do? 

*You:* You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organisation. You’ll give me everything I need to complete the project as and when and in the format we need it. You’ll review my work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner too. Deadlines work two ways, so you’ll also be bound by dates we set together. 

*Me:* I have the experience and ability to do everything I've agreed with you and we’ll do it all in a professional and timely manner. I'll endeavour to meet every deadline that’s set and on top of that we'll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give me.

## Getting down to the nitty gritty 

### Design 

I'll create look-and-feel designs, and flexible layouts that adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. I create designs iteratively and use predominantly HTML and CSS so we won’t waste time mocking up every template as a static visual. I may use static visuals to indicate a look-and-feel direction (color, texture and typography.) 

You’ll have plenty of opportunities to review my work and provide feedback. I'll share my work using Basecamp and GitHub and have regular contact.

### Text content 

I'm not responsible for writing or inputting any text copy. If you’d like me to write new content or input text for you let me know, otherwise I will pull directly from the current copy.

### Photographs

I will search for some new stock photos to include.

### HTML, CSS and JavaScript

I deliver web page types developed from HTML5 markup, CSS2.1 + 3 stylesheets for styling and unobtrusive JavaScript for feature detection, poly-fills and behaviours.

### Browser testing

Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a person’s experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.

### Desktop browser testing

I test my work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Internet Explorer), Mozilla Firefox and Opera. I’ll also test to ensure Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 for Windows users get an appropriate, possibly different, experience. 

### Mobile browser testing

Testing popular small-screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person’s experience of a design is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they’re using. I test my work in:

iOS: Safari, Google Chrome Android 4.x: Google Chrome and Firefox

I currently don’t test Blackberry, Opera Mini/Mobile, Windows Phone or other mobile browsers. If you have concerns about these platforms we can discuss further testing.

###Technical support

I don’t offer support for website hosting, email or other services relating to hosting, but I can set up your site on a server, plus any statistics software such as Google Analytics.

###Changes and revisions

If you want to change your mind or add anything new, that won’t be a problem.

###Legal stuff

I can’t guarantee that our work will be error-free and so I can’t be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you’ve advised me of them. Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

Phew.

###Copyrights

First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by your good selves, or that you’ve permission to use them.

Then, when the project is final, copyright will be automatically assigned as follows:

You’ll own the visual elements that we create for this project. I'll give you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as I'm not required to keep a copy. You own all elements of text, images and data you provided, unless someone else owns them.

I'll own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design and I'll license its use to you, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only, unless we agree otherwise.

I love to show off my work and share what I’ve learned with other people, so I reserve the right, with your permission, to display and link to your project as part of my portfolio and to write about it on websites, in magazine articles and in books.

###Small Print


Just like a parking ticket, you can’t transfer this contract to anyone else without our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of U.S. courts.

This Project is part of a Portland Code School capstone project.
