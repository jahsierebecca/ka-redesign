Karnes Allen Group is an executive recruitment agency that works with job seekers and employers in the Boise, Idaho area. The agency is looking to broaden their client base and attract new business. This website will introduce visitors to the company and employ best practices of SEO and UI to generate more traffic to the site and appeal more to visitors. 


Client Brief 
------------

Karnes Allen Group (KAG) is an executive recruitment agency that primarily works with community hospitals that have a 20 to 100 bed range and in house medical clinics. The website has two primary audiences: potential clients and potential candidates for open positions. KAG provides senior to mid-level professional recruiting, so the website should be explicit about their client base. The new website should increase traffic and new contacts as well as increase brand awareness. 

The target audience (employers and potential clients) will likely be viewing the website from different browsers. Employers will be visiting the page from their desktop computers at work, (often not on the newest hardware or software). Job seekers are at the executive level and much more likely to be viewing the site from mobile devices and newer browsers. The website should look good on old browsers as well as new ones. The overall look needs to be clean and professional but not big city. Something similar to this website: http://www.nwstaffing.com/

The domain name www.karnesallengroup.com has already been purchased and the current website is viewable at that address. The website will be promoted on the company's Linkedin and in client communications.
